Maven comes with 3 built-in build life cycles:

Clean - this phase involves cleaning of the project (for a fresh build & deployment)
Default - this phase handles the complete deployment of the project
Site - this phase handles the generating the java documentation of the project

Build Lifecycle of clean phase:
The command used to clean up the project and make it ready for the fresh compile and deployment is mvn post-clean. When this command is invoked,maven executes the below tasks by executing the below commands internally:
mvn pre-clean
mvn clean
mvn post-clean
On executing it cleans up the output directory (target folder) by deleting all the compiled files.

Build Lifecycle of Default phase:
validate
generate-sources
process-sources
generate-sources

generate-test-sources
test-compile

Build Lifecycle of Site phase:
This phase provided by maven generates the detailed documentation of any java project.
This project documentation has a dedicated phases involved as listed below:
pre-site
site

The command used in maven to generate javadocs for a given project is 'mvn site'.When this command is invoked, maven calls 'Doxia' document generation and other report generating plugins.
